Plot summary -

Kel, though allowed to continue her training by instructor Wyldon of Cavall, 
is still not accepted by many ofthe male pages, and is therefore supported by Neal, Merric, Cleon, 
and Owen against Joren.
At the beginning of the book,Kel hires Lalasa, after her mistreatment by other relatives.
Kel also adopts a stray dog who calls himself Jump, and a flock of songbirds. 
Thereafter the book follows Kel's education, Lalasa and Jump are kidnapped;
whereupon Kel and her friends rescue them.Kel had proved her worthiness of being a leader when she guides her 
group of fellow pages through the "Battle of the Cliff".
Lord Wyldon continues to make life hard for Kel by forcing her to improve her jousting skills, 
(She called the routine maddening) 
and made her join the elite page archers group, which Kel does 
more enthusiastically because if she advances, 
she gets to "play" with different kinds of arrows.Lord Wyldon also tries to humiliate Kel by
making her "leader" of a fighting group while another page leads
the other group, and they have a mock battle, which Kel's group always wins.
